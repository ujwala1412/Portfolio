    <h3>Jan 2025 – May 2025 | Capstone Project: Low-Cost PCOS Prediction Using Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>
      Developed and evaluated predictive models for diagnosing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using non-imaging clinical and hormonal markers to address diagnostic limitations in low-resource settings. Applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes in Python, with AMH and clinical symptoms identified as key predictors. Achieved high model performance (ROC-AUC up to 0.94 with ultrasound and strong results without), supporting the feasibility of affordable, imaging-independent PCOS diagnosis.

    <h3>Aug 2024 – Dec 2024 | Connecting Language and Statistical Model</h3>
    <p>
      Explored the effectiveness of Citalopram in treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using data from the All of Us Research Program, focusing on the impact of missing clinical data on treatment outcomes. Emphasized the importance of high-quality data and advanced predictive modeling to personalize depression treatments and improve patient outcomes.

    <h3>Aug 2024 – Dec 2024 | Predicting Diabetes Diagnosis Using Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes diagnosis by analyzing patient data and key risk factors. Implemented and evaluated algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, J48, and Naïve Bayes, with J48 identified as the most balanced for real-world applications. Conducted data preprocessing, feature selection, and performance assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics. Findings highlight AI's potential in early diabetes detection, contributing to personalized healthcare and preventive strategies.

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Aug 2024 – Dec 2024 | Medical Image Analysis on Breast Cancer</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a breast cancer detection system using image processing techniques such as noise reduction, edge detection, image enhancement, segmentation, and fusion to improve diagnostic accuracy. Integrated these techniques into imaging modalities like mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs, enhancing early detection and clinical decision-making. Leveraged deep learning algorithms to refine efficiency and precision, contributing to improved patient outcomes.

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Jan 2024 – Apr 2024 | Diabetes Prediction</h3>
    <p>
      Created a machine learning model to forecast the likelihood of diabetes in women aged 21 and above. The model predicts diabetes risk accurately using important clinical factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, skin thickness, insulin, and diabetic pedigree function. This tool supports healthcare professionals in accelerating diagnosis and boosting patient outcomes.

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Aug 2023 – Dec 2023 | Analysis of Inova Fairfax Hospital Readmissions Data</h3>
    <p>
      Analyzed readmission rates at Inova Fairfax Hospital, revealing higher Excess Readmission Ratios (ERRs) for heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to other conditions like AMI and pneumonia. Recommended strategies to reduce ERRs through improved care delivery, aiming to bring them closer to national averages.

    <h3>Jul 2019 – Jan 2020 | Thesis: An Observational Study on Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome in a Coalmine Hospital</h3>
    <p>
      Conducted a comparative study at Singareni Collieries Company Limited, Main Hospital, Bhadradri Kothagudem, to determine the prevalence of PCOS risk factors and complications among patients versus individuals without PCOS, identifying unique clinical trends in the coal mining population.
